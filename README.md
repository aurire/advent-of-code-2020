# Advent of Code 2020

Tried to do this year in Python which I never used before and always wanted to try. Don't judge too much, especialy first tasks as main goal was just to get the right answer. I finished this advent of code two days past Dec-24 - as I was stuck with day 19-part2. At that point I left the game for several days and came back with fresh mind and finished the task later and had to run back, but was late two days.
